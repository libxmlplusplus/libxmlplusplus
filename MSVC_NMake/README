Building libxml++ with Visual Studio 2017 or later

* You will need Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 15.7) or later, as C++-17 is required and only 15.7 or later had
  enough C++-17 support
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development files from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+/
* Install libxml2 from http://xmlsoft.org/.  If building libxml2 from source, using Visual Studio 2015 or
  later is strongly recommended.
* Build libsigc++ 3.0.0 and glibmm from source, with the same compiler version. with building libxml++.  If
  there are strange linker errors, they are likely caused by mising different compiler versions.
* Add GTK+, libsigc++ and glibmm to the include and lib paths in Visual Studio.
* Run `nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=[debug|release]` to buiild libxml++.  Run `nmake /f Makefile.vc` without the
  `CFG=[debug|release] flag to see which options are supported by the NMake Makefiles
